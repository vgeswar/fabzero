During emergency, hit the stop button.Always it is recommended to have one more person while working with this machine.

This machine will work smoothly for more than ten years. If power goes off then it is almost like loss of work for beginners. Next, we had a demo on W-band-saw tool. It is works like a hacksaw blade cutter. It is not a flexible cutter which means difficult to cut curved patterns. The next tool is scroll saw.It is works like a hacksaw blade cutter but more flexible.
