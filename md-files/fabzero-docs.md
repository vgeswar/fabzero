 ***FABLAB Tour***
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *A batch of participants are visited the FABLAB facilities on first day of training program i.e 18th of March’2019. During this session, Sh.Shibu explained each and every equipments which is equipped in the Lab and we are interacted with Sh.shibu, about the functionality of the all equipments [*Read more...*](/md-files/fablabvisit.md)*

 ***Vinyl Cutter*** 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 *This LAB equipped with [**Roland**](https://www.rolanddga.com/products/vinyl-cutters/camm-1-gs-24-desktop-vinyl-cutter) CAMM-1 GS-24 vinyl cutter. It is a Desktop cutter.The maximum cutting width area for this machine is 22.9 inches. Using this machine we can cut your own designed logos, images and stickers [*Read more...*](/md-files/vinyl-cutter.md)*
 
***3D Printer***  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*3D printing is any of various process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file. 3D printing enables you to produce complex shapes.The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additive process an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced horizontal cross-section of the eventual object. In this session we worked with [**Sindoh**](https://3dprinter.sindoh.com/product/dp200) 3DWAX DP200 model 3D printer.The DP200 printer was designed to introduce inexperienced users to 3D printing technology*

***3D Design & Printing***
------------------------------------------------
*Our mentor instructed to us design something useful for our lab. So my batch consists of three members decided to design the Bit-Stand for holding the pcb milling bits. In this process we are using [**FreeCAD**](https://www.freecadweb.org/) software for perform the 3D design. FreeCAD is a popular open source design software for creating 3D models of real-life objects.* [*Read More...*](/md-files/3D-design.md)

***PCB Design & Miller Cutter***
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Design the Schematic circuit and draw the PCB layout was performed by [**KiCAD**](http://kicad-pcb.org/) software and we used the [**DGSHAPE**](https://www.dgshape.com/product/srm-20) SRM20 model miller cutter machine for milling the PCB board.The SRM-20’s VPanel controller provides a simple interface for adjusting tool position and moving the cursor to set the milling starting point. The VPanel also allows easy control of feed rate and spindle speed with pause and resume operation, plus tracking of X, Y, Z axis milling with a numeric readout in millimeters or inches.*[*Read More...*](/md-files/pcb-design.md)

***Shopbot Machine***
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*[Shopbot](https://support.shopbottools.com/products/alpha) is a CNC solution for production that delivers high performance, high volume, speed and reliable power for all cutting tasks. This CNC delivers affordable, full-production performance in digital fabrication of wood, plastic and other materials. It is a biggest and almost dangerous machine in our lab.Safety is very important when using this machine.*[*Read More...*](/md-files/shopbot-machine.md)

***Stratasys 3D Printer***
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*This 3D Printer [**Stratasys**](https://www.stratasys.com/3d-printers/objet30-pro) can  Create high-end prototypes, realistic models with specialized properties, and more. The UV rays being use to print the object.This is similar to inkjet printer. We can print the object maximum of 30CM x 20CM. i.e X-300mm, Y-200mm and Z-200mm.*[Read More...](/md-files/stratasys-3D-printer.md)

***Laser-Cutter***
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*In this lab we have Epilog-Fusion M2 Laser cutter.The Fusion M2 is a dual-source laser system that allows users to perform both metal marking applications and CO2 laser applications from the same system, in the same job.*[Read More...](/md-files/laser-cutter.md)
