***Description:***    
*iBELL is an Intelligent BELL. It is a normal electronic BELL programmed to behave intelligent role. Whenever anybody misuses or tries to fool, it goes to "freezing mode" and gets activated after specified time. ie, If you press the switch and hold for more time its automatically switched to "Freeze Mode". Also, if anybody repeatedly presses the switch it enters to "Freeze Mode". Like this, several cases of events are worked out and programmed to behave intelligently.*

***PCB Design:***  
*The Circuit design, Schematic diagram, extraction of trace and cut files are discussed in detail in the Fablab menu under PCB design and cutting is done using the Micro miller which is described in detail in the Fablab menu under Micro miller.*

***Implementation:***   
*Now, the components are soldered as per the PCB design on the circuit board. We have arrived at two circuit boards, one is the micro controller circuit and another one  is the MOSFET connected to the speaker. We have also used additional 2 nos.of 50ohm resistors connected in parallel to suppress the generated heat. Oscilloscope was used to verify the working functionality of the speaker.*

***List of Components used:***  
- *Resistors--500 ohms: 4 Nos.*  
- *Resistors--10 ohms: 2 Nos.*  
- *LED : Green & Blue -Each 1 No*   
- *Micro Controller -- ATtiny 44: 1 No.*   
- *Capacitor-- 1 Micro Farad : 1 No.*      
- *Switch: 1 No.*   
- *ISP Header: 1 No.*  
- *Speaker: 1 No.*    
- *Mosfet: 1 No.*

***Coding:***   
*AVR program was written as per our requirement. Through the programmer, using Arduino, we have compiled and successfully loaded the AVR code in to the micro controller to work intelligently as per our requirements.*

***3D Design for iBELL Outer Case:***   
*The 3d iBELL outer Case was designed using freecad sogtware and the same was  loaded in to 3D printer. After 28 minutes, we are ready with the outer Casing for iBELL.
Now we have packed all the iBELL components inside the 3D caseâ€¦*

***Vinyl Name sticker for iBELL:***   
*iBELL name sticker was designed using the inscape and cut it through the Vinyl cutter. We got a beautiful name sticker, which was stuck at both sides of the iBELL case.*
