***3D Printer***  
*3D printing is any of various process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file. 3D printing enables you to produce complex shapes.The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additive process an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced horizontal cross-section of the eventual object.*

 *In this session we worked with [**Sindoh**](https://3dprinter.sindoh.com/product/dp200) 3DWAX DP200 model 3D printer.The DP200 printer was designed to introduce inexperienced users to 3D printing technologyIn this session we worked with [**Sindoh**](https://3dprinter.sindoh.com/product/dp200) 3DWAX DP200 model 3D printer.The Poly-Lactic Acid(PLA) has been used as filament in this printer.The filament is 1.75mm in diameter and a cartridge can hold 700 gram of filament.The filament should be tightly wound in to the cartridge. To feed the cartridge in the printer, use the **Load** command through the touch screen in top of the printer.similar way to remove the cartridge use the **Unload** command.Printer nozzle will be heated up to 200 degree C for printing the object*

*We are using [Thinkverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) site to download the object and used [3DWOX Desktop](https://3dprinter.sindoh.com/en/support/downloads) software for design the object. This software provided by the printer manufacture.*

*I was selected the **Spinning-Top** object for my assignment. First, the said object image was downloaded and load to the 3DWOx software.*

*In this assignment I had a great experience. i.e the spinning top has overhang region,hence support has required. Without support we didn't get the output as it is the image.The difference for the same as follow: ![spnnbase](/img/spt-base.jpg)* 

*My first trail was given to the printer without support.Hence, the printer gave me the product like this ![prout-wout-base](/img/prout-without-base.jpg)* 

*After that I added the support in my image.After completion of the above said process, the image loaded to the printer.Once loaded the image the same is shown in the printer's screen like this*

*After calculating the temperature, the printer will start to print.*

*Finally, my first product from the 3D printer was came out.![printout](/img/3D-output.jpg)*
