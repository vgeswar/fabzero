## Day-1 Summary (Date: 18.03.2019)- 6.00PM
We had a formal launch of Pre-fab Academy Training at STPI-Bhuvaneshwar Campus.
All the participants introduced themselves to others. The mentors Mr.Sanfrancisco and Mr.Sibu gave a brief speech on the sessions
Director STPI-Bhuvaneshwar briefed us on how the idea of having PreFab lab at Bhuvaneshwar started.Then, he requested every participant to understand and work hard to become future mentor. Also he requested everyone to take it forward to every center across the country to set up similar lab in their centers by taking support from the respective State Government.

Finally, Director General STPI congratulated the Director for launching the Fablab and  requested everyone to work hard.

The session started at 11.30AM. Brief introduction on the lab and the purpose of the lab was discussed.Then after the lunch break we went to the fablab. 

First we had a brief demo on shopbot(subractive) Machine. It is a Computer Numerical Control(CNC) milling tool. It is 3axis cutter and used for working with 2D & 3D cutting tool. The resulotion is ont 10th of a millimeter. saftey is very important when using this machine. During emergency, hit the stop button.Always it is recommanded to have one more person while working with this machine.

This machine will work smoothly for more than ten years. If power goes off then it is almost like loss of work for beginners. Next, we had a demo on W-band-saw tool. It is works like a hacksaw blade cutter. It is not a fliexible cutter which means difficult to cut curved patterns. The nest tools is scrollsaw.It is works like a hacksaw blade cutter. but more fliexible.

 Next tool is cleaning tool which cleans support stressor(clay). Next we had a demo on SRM-20 tool which is a micro milling machine whose resoulation is 100th inches. The commonely used diameter is 0.4mm, 0.8mm upto 6mm. Fiber class is not to be used.

We had a quick look at oscilloscop, power supply, functional generato, epilog laser. We had a vinyle cutter(Sticker cutter). maximum 80grams equivalent force can be applied. It acts like plotter, draw images and act like stencil and screen printer. Then we had look at copper roll, lacer cutter engraving, 3D structures. 80W Co2 laser, 10.2 micro meter. Here we cann't to use metal. Becose it produce the smoke.

 We had a prief look at Air filtter whci sucks dust particles but gases will remain. Don't open immediately after using laser cutter. Don't cut anything very thin like paper and glass cutting is not permitter but engraving is permitter  Next we had 3D printers(Additive). Which is a single material printer. i.e fused filament deposit, uv curable which is a streo lethographty polimerisation. Injective 3D printer-STRATASOS which can subbort two materials. special nocile full colour additional future. Then back to session where we learnt about documantation and created a new account and started creative new repository
