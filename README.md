*A Fab Lab is a small workshop offering personal digital fabrication.The fab labs are equipped with an array of CNC(Computer Controlled Machines) that help you to get a prototypes of your ideas.*

*The objective of Fablabs is to encourage the innovation, technology development, product prototyping and maker learning. This will empower the maker-entrepreneurial culture, which at present is confined to ICT/ electronics domain. The Fablab programme will lead to a cross learning culture among multiple technology sectors and create a robust platform for the upcoming entrepreneurs to create indigenous technology products.*
