*My Three weeks drive at Pre-Fab Academy Training Program at STPI-Bhubanewar Campus.*  
*We are trained by two legends Sh.Fransisco & Sh.Sibu*
             
***Introduction***     
*A Fab Lab (Fabrication Laboratory)  is a small workshop offering personal digital fabrication.The fab labs are equipped with an array of CNC(Computer Controlled Machines) that help you to get a prototypes of your ideas.PreFab Academy is a 3 weeks training program to help us to get a hands on experience in the fab lab machines.*

*In this prefab academy we learned theoretically 3D-design operate the 3D printers and vinyl cutter.Similarly, we learned design the electronic circuit in PCB and operate the miller cutter.* 

 ***Inaugural Session***  
 *We had a formal launch of Pre-fab Academy Training at [**STPI- Bhubaneswar**](http://www.bbs.stpi.in/) Campus.Director Sh.Manas Panda welcomed Director General-[**STPI**](https://www.stpi.in/) and other colleagues. He briefed us on how the idea of having PreFab lab at Bhuvaneshwar started

 ***FABLAB Tour***   
 *A batch of participants are visited the FABLAB facilities on first day of training program i.e 18th of Marchâ€™2019. During this session, Sh.Shibu explained each and every equipments which is equipped in the Lab and we are interacted with Sh.shibu, about the functionality of the all equipments [*Read more...*](/md-files/fablabvisit.md)*

 ***Vinyl Cutter***     
 *This LAB equipped with [**Roland**](https://www.rolanddga.com/products/vinyl-cutters/camm-1-gs-24-desktop-vinyl-cutter) CAMM-1 GS-24 vinyl cutter. It is a Desktop cutter.The maximum cutting width area for this machine is 22.9 inches. Using this machine we can cut your own designed logos, images and stickers [*Read more...*](/md-files/vinyl-cutter.md)*

**Shopbot Machine**

![Shopbot-Machine](shopbot.jpg)

First we had a brief demo on shopbot(subtractive model) Machine. It is a Computer Numerical Control(CNC) milling tool. It is 3axis cutter and used for wooden materials and aluminium .Safety is very important when using this machine. During emergency, hit the stop button.Always it is recommended to have one more person while working with this machine.

This machine will work smoothly for more than ten years. If power goes off then it is almost like loss of work for beginners. Next, we had a demo on W-band-saw tool. It is works like a hacksaw blade cutter. It is not a flexible cutter which means difficult to cut curved patterns. The next tool is scroll saw.It is works like a hacksaw blade cutter but more flexible.

**Cleaning Tool** cleaning tool which cleans support stressor(clay).  

**Micro-Milling-Mahine** 
![Micro-Milling-Cutter](Mini-milling-machine.jpeg)      
Micro milling machine whose resolution is 100th inches. The commonly used diameter is 0.4mm, 0.8mm up to 6mm. Fiber class is not to be used.

We had a quick look at oscilloscope, power supply, functional generate, epilog laser. 

**Laser Cutter** 

![Laser Cutter](laser-cutter.jpeg)  

lacer cutter engraving, 3D structures. 80W Co2 laser, 10.2 micro meter. In this machine we can't to use metal. Because it produce the smoke. We had a brief look at Air filter which sucks dust particles but gases will remain. Don't open immediately after using laser cutter. Don't cut anything very thin like paper and glass cutting is not permitted but engraving is permitted.

**3D Printer** 

![3D Printer](3Dprinter.jpeg) 

3D printers(Additive). Which is a single material printer. i.e fused filament deposit, UV curable which is a stereo lithography polymerization. Injective 3D printer-STRATASOS which can support two materials.

Then back to session where we learnt about documentation and created a new account and started creative new repository

## Day-2 Summary (Date:19.03.2019) 11.30AM
     
Installed the softwares spell checker, inkscope and cura   
 **Spell Checker** - Used to spell check in visual code   
 **inkscope** - Inkscape is professional quality vector graphics software   
 **Cura** - Advanced 3D Printing Software   

Mentor Mr.Franscisco, explained how the files and photos are uploaded in to the fabzero login.i.e. portal. The text file in the Visual Studio Code should be commit with the message.Every time this process is required when the changes are made in the text file.

Downloaded and installed the Git for Windows OS for using git:clone command in Visual Studio Code.After installed, open the Visual Studio Code and type Ctrl+Shift+P and enter git:clone and paste the repository link which is obtained from the portal and folder to be select for repository clone.

Now, we can upload the README.md(text file) from Visual Studio Code. i.e open the txt file through Visual Studio and modify as it required and commit the changes and hit the push command, Now the modified file is uploaded in to the portal.
