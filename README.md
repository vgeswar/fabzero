## Day-1 Summary (Date: 18.03.2019)- 6.00PM
We had a formal launch of Pre-fab Academy Training at STPI-Bhubaneswar Campus.
All the participants introduced themselves to others. The mentors Mr.Sanfrancisco and Mr.Sibu gave a brief speech on the sessions
Director STPI-Bhubaneswar briefed us on how the idea of having PreFab lab at Bhuvaneshwar started.Then, he requested every participant to understand and work hard to become future mentor. Also he requested everyone to take it forward to every center across the country to set up similar lab in their centers by taking support from the respective State Government.

Finally, Director General STPI congratulated the Director for launching the Fablab and  requested everyone to work hard.

The session started at 11.30AM. Brief introduction on the lab and the purpose of the lab was discussed.Then after the lunch break we went to the Fablab. 

First we had a brief demo on shopbot(subtractive) Machine. It is a Computer Numerical Control(CNC) milling tool. It is 3axis cutter and used for working with 2D & 3D cutting tool. The resolution is not 10th of a millimeter. safety is very important when using this machine. During emergency, hit the stop button.Always it is recommended to have one more person while working with this machine.

This machine will work smoothly for more than ten years. If power goes off then it is almost like loss of work for beginners. Next, we had a demo on W-band-saw tool. It is works like a hacksaw blade cutter. It is not a flexible cutter which means difficult to cut curved patterns. The nest tools is scroll saw.It is works like a hacksaw blade cutter. but more flexible.

**Cleaning Tool** cleaning tool which cleans support stressor(clay). 
**Micro-Milling-Mahine** 
![Micro-Milling-Cutter](Mini-milling-machine.jpeg)    
Micro milling machine whose resolution is 100th inches. The commonly used diameter is 0.4mm, 0.8mm up to 6mm. Fiber class is not to be used.

We had a quick look at oscilloscope, power supply, functional generate, epilog laser.   
**vinyl cutter**-   

![Vinylcutter](vinyl-cutter.jpeg)   
 It acts like plotter, draw images and act like stencil and screen printer.
**Laser Cutter** lacer cutter engraving, 3D structures. 80W Co2 laser, 10.2 micro meter. In this machine we can't to use metal. Because it produce the smoke. We had a brief look at Air filter which sucks dust particles but gases will remain. Don't open immediately after using laser cutter. Don't cut anything very thin like paper and glass cutting is not permitted but engraving is permitted.
**3D Printer** 3D printers(Additive). Which is a single material printer. i.e fused filament deposit, uv curable which is a stereo lithography polymerization. Injective 3D printer-STRATASOS which can support two materials.
Then back to session where we learnt about documentation and created a new account and started creative new repository
